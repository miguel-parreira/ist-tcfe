\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an Audio Amplifier has been
achieved. The output analyses has been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results differed from the theoretical results as was expected because of the non-linear components used. The final merit was of 1194.911322 with a cost of 3095.24 $MU$, for the simulation the Voltage gain, bandwith and lower cut off frequency were of $57.09831355$, $2864235.782 Hz$ and $44.2183Hz$, respectively.
The diferences in the gain, input and output impedances between the theoretical and simulation analysis are explained by the difference in simplicity between the incremental model and all the approximations used in the theoretical analyse and the very complex model used by ngspice.
