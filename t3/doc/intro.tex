% state the learning objective
\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build a AC/DC converter using a transformer,  envelope detector and a voltage regulator. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.\\


In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit was built ,tested and adjusted to give the expected results.
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, it was used the ideal model diode  to study the envelope detector and the real model to solve the voltage regulator (using Newton Raphsonâ€™s iterative method). The results are compared to the simulation results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
