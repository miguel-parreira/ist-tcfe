\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an AC/DC converter has been
achieved. The output analyses has been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results differed from the theoretical results
by an error of $2,94\%$ on the output average, as was expected because of the non-linear components used. The final merit was of 0.8008433839 with a cost of 227.4055 $MU$, for he simulation the average and ripple were of $12.00000 V$ and $0.00549 V$, respectively, and for the theoretical analyses the average and ripple were of $11.647198 V$ and $0.04545 V$, respectively.
