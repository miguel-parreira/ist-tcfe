% state the learning objective 
\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
DC voltage source $V_I$ and a DC current source connected to seven resistors $R_{1-7}$, a linear voltage-controlled current source and a  linear current-controlled voltage source. The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.\\



In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, it was used the mesh and node analysis methods to solve the circuit. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
